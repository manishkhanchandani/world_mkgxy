The bizarre series of incidents began about 8:50 p.m. Friday when the suspect, fully unclothed, entered a home on the 100 block of Colorado Avenue through an unlocked front door, charged a teenage juvenile and punched him at least once before running away, police said. The suspect, later identified as Daiki Glenn Minaki, 18, of Palo Alto, then attacked a woman in her 50s who was walking her dog on the block, tackling her from behind and punching and kicking her repeatedly while [...]</div></li><li><div class="itemTitle"><a href="http://blog.sfgate.com/crime/2014/04/04/court-reluctantly-bars-state-sentence-because-youths-last-crime-was-nonviolent/" target="_self">Court reluctantly bars state sentence because youth’s last crime was nonviolent</a></div><div class="itemDate">4/4/2014</div><div class="itemContent">Sometimes a court, even the state’s highest court, questions the result of the ruling it’s about to issue but finds that the law is clear-cut. That’s what happened this week when the California Supreme Court rejected a state sentence for a teenager whose crimes were mostly violent — but not the most recent one. Sixteen-year-old D.B. was convicted in a Sacramento County juvenile court of a series of crimes that started in May 2010 when he punched a man in the face, breaking his jaw, then, along with a companion, took the man’s&nbsp;wallet and drove off in&nbsp;his car. Police spotted him later that day in another stolen car,&nbsp;but he got [...]</div></li><li><div class="itemTitle"><a href="http://blog.sfgate.com/crime/2014/04/04/s-f-gun-buyback-set-saturday-in-visitacion-valley/" target="_self">S.F. gun buyback set Saturday in Visitacion Valley</a></div><div class="itemDate">4/4/2014</div><div class="itemContent">San Francisco will host a citywide gun buyback in Visitacion Valley on Saturday, with city officials offering up to $200 — no questions asked — in exchange for people’s weapons in an effort to get them off the streets and out of people’s homes. Cities have been conducting buybacks for years in an effort to cut down on gun violence. Earlier events have resulted in San Franciscans turning in a total of 529 guns. “It’s a complicated problem,” said Sarah Rogers, civilian co-chair of Ingleside Station’s Community Police Advisory Board, one of the groups helping with Saturday’s buyback. “There’s no easy fix to it at all. Especially with the limits [...]</div></li><li><div class="itemTitle"><a href="http://blog.sfgate.com/crime/2014/04/03/police-find-pot-in-sheep-field-manger-suspect-arrested/" target="_self">Police find pot in sheep field manger; suspect arrested</a></div><div class="itemDate">4/4/2014</div><div class="itemContent">A marijuana grow suspect stopped by Rohnert Park police for a traffic violation rushed home afterward and was caught trying to hide a pot-growing operation, authorities said. It started about 1 p.m. Tuesday, when an officer with the Rohnert Park Department of Public Safety pulled over Daren Van Dyke, 34, for an unspecific traffic violation on Highway 101. During the stop, the officer found evidence that Van Dyke was involved in a marijuana-growing and -trafficking operation, police said. Van Dyke was allowed to leave, but police obtained a search warrant for his home on Chapman Lane west of Petaluma. While waiting for the warrant to be authorized, police went to [...]</div></li><li><div class="itemTitle"><a href="http://blog.sfgate.com/crime/2014/04/02/chp-plane-helps-in-arrest-of-motorcycle-stunt-suspect/" target="_self">CHP plane helps in arrest of motorcycle stunt suspect</a></div><div class="itemDate">4/3/2014</div><div class="itemContent">While doing wheelies on a motorcycle at up to 120 mph on an Oakland freeway, Corey McDonah, 23, probably had no idea that a California Highway Patrol airplane was tracking him on video, authorities say. It started about 3:40 p.m. when the CHP plane, Air 37, spotted a man on an orange Kawasaki motorcycle&nbsp;traveling 100 and 120 mph on eastbound Interstate 580 near the MacArthur Maze in Oakland, the CHP said. The pilot saw the rider doing wheelies and other stunts — including standing on the bike — and relayed the information to patrol cruisers. The man got off the freeway at 35th Avenue and, with the plane still overhead, [...]</div></li></ul></div>
